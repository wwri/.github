### üî• The Project:
The Western Wildfire Resilience Index will measure and communicate the wildfire resilience at the community level. This project will calculate index scores for coupled human-ecological communities in the western regions of the U.S. and Canada to inform decision-makers when crafting wildfire preparedness, response, and recovery policies. 

### üë§ The Team:
Our team consists of a project manager, a communications and policy officer, a web developer, and a trio of data analysts. Collectively, our experience is wide-ranging across the environmental data science, journalism, and software development domains. We are a self-contained research group operating out of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) located in Santa Barbara, California. You can find out more about the Center at the [NCEAS website](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), as well as the [NCEAS GitHub](https://github.com/NCEAS).

### ü§ù Our Partners:
We are excited to partner with the [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/) for this project as part of their [Wildfire Resilience Initiative](https://www.moore.org/initiative-strategy-detail?initiativeId=wildfire-resilience-initiative)! In addition to the Moore Foundation, our team is advised by a number of wildfire experts across a the following domains: forestry, data science, water policy, and disaster resilience.
